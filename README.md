## Strings AKA Indices

Strings can be defined as sequential collections of characters.  This means that the individual characters that make up the string are assumed to be in a particular order from left to right.

A string that contains no characters, referred to as the **empty string**, is still considered to be a string.  It is simply a sequence of zero characters and is represented by '' or "" (two single or two double quotes with nothing in between).

You cannot perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look like numbers.  The one exception to this rule is that the + operator does work with strings, but for strings, the + operator represents **concatenation** , not addition. 

The beginning character of a string corresponds to index 0 and the last character corresponds to the index (length of string)-1.

The length of a string is the number of characters it contains, including spaces and punctuation.  




## Putting the FUN in FUNctions!  

This week we went over functions again and that helped my understanding of the concept much better. 

A function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.  In order for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relation between the input and the output.  To use a function, you must define it from where you want to call it. 
 

## Booleans 

A **boolean** represents one of two values: `true` or `false`.  

Some important things to remember when using a **boolean** is the following:

* '!' before a variable will 'flip' something or be the 'opposite'

* '&&' is like 'and' 

* '===' is a QUESTION.

* !== is NOT EQUAL TO.


## If / Else / Else if AKA "Conditionals" 

The **"if"** statement is the fundament control statement that allows JS to make decisions and execute statements.

The **"if else"** statement allows you to execute statements in a more controlled way.  

The **if else if**  is where things get  more advanced.  It is a series of **if** statements, where each **if** is a part of the **else** of the previous statement.  Statements are executed based on the true condition, if none of the conditions are true, the the **else** block is executed.
